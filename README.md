# Local-AI-Agent
A lightweight command-line AI agent that runs fully on your machine with Ollama (default: llama3.1:8b). It can chat, call safe local utilities (read/write files, search, hash, zip, convert units, math, fetch web pages, etc.), and keep short-term memory for notes/todos â€” all inside your project folder.
